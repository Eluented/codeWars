Using the git terminal only I have commited the solution for 2 questions
Learned that if it is failing to push either force it by using git push -f (which is not ideal)

Or sync your git with the changes by using fetch: 
git fetch origin master (use -m to write a message otherwise unix text editer will blow your mind - tips for unix: insert to edit then esc and :wq and enter)
git merge origin master
