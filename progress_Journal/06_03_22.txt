Completed some katas using python today was a bit rusty but still not too bad, learnt new methods for both javascript and python - concat() adds an array to another array
.slice() does not mutate the original array - use it in return statements
use git pull when the .git file in your pc is not in sync with the repos on github
the eval() method parses strings with mathematical operator
min() and max() can work on arrays/lists instead of making two for loops yourself to compare 

suggestion: work on the odin project and get some web dev done to prepare
